ProBank USSD System is a Node.js + Express application that provides a simple mobile banking experience through USSD. Phase 1 includes a working USSD menu with options for user registration, money transfers, balance inquiry, loan services, help, and exit. User data is stored in a SQL Server database, and PINs are handled securely. The system integrates Winston-based logging for monitoring requests and debugging, laying the foundation for advanced features like full transaction handling and loan management in later phases.
